# Odin-Sign-up-Form
This is a project for the Odin Project Curriculum
where I created a sign-up sheet!

The main function of the website is a form which
includes validation for the fields.

The purpose of this project is to showcase my
skills in HTML as well as advanced CSS including
the creation of forms!
